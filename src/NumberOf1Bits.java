/*
Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and returns the 
number of â€™1' bits it has (also known as the Hamming weight).

For example, the 32-bit integer â€™11' has binary representation 
00000000000000000000000000001011, so the function should return 3.

		int count = 0;

			// need to use != instead of >0 is because of overflow
			count += n & 1;
